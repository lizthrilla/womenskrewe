# Women&#39;s Krewe

I coach Tampa Bay's women's rugby team.  We needed a new website and I took this on as part of a project for my TIY class.  This was created to demonstrate how to work with React router and google map's API.  I am still working to fully integrate the map API, so it is not live at the [website](www.krewewomensrugby.com).
